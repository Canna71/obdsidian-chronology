Clicking on the name of the note will open it. Ctrl-(or Command-) clicking the note name will open it in a new pane.

In the calendar you can select the single days or the week number (on the left).

The days tiles background gives an indication about how many notes were created or edited that day. The scale depends also on the average number of daily notes set in the settings.
